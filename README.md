<h1>XML Reader to CSV Converter</h1>

This project is a simple XML reader and converter that allows users to select a folder and read all XML files within that folder. The tool then creates a CSV (Excel-compatible) file containing either CNPJ, CPF, or both along with the respective entity names (company names or individuals' names). Users can choose the search criteria (CPF, CNPJ, or both) for extraction.

<h2>Features</h2>
<strong>XML File Parsing:</strong> The program parses XML files present in the selected folder.
Search by CPF, CNPJ, or Both: Users can choose whether to extract data based on CPF, CNPJ, or both.
CSV File Creation: The extracted data is saved to a CSV file, making it easy to view and analyze in Excel.
